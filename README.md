Try these:
**FXAA:** OFF
**MSAA:** 2x – Recommended if you have an NVIDIA RTX Card
**Nvidia TXAA:** ON – Recommended if you have an NVIDIA RTX Card
**vSync:** OFF
**Population Density / Variety / Distance Scaling:** 50% - The lower the better
**Extended Texture Budget:** Less than 50%
**Texture Quality:** Normal or High. Ultra textures can eat up VRAM.
**Shader Quality:** Normal is a good balance. High if you've got FPS to spare.
**Shadow Quality:** This is a real FPS hog. Start with Normal.
**Reflection Quality:** Set to Normal. Those shiny puddles aren't worth the FPS hit.
**Reflection MSAA:** OFF – Set to 2x if puddles are super-pixelated.
**Particle Quality:** Normal or High.
**Grass Quality:** Normal.
**Soft Shadows:** Soft.
**Post FX:** High – Normal can also be selected but may result in a duller-looking environment.
**Motion Blur Strength:** Around 20% for a faster-looking gameplay experience
**Anisotropic Filtering:** Has no impact on modern cards, x16 for sharpness but on older graphic cards, OFF should be preferrable.
**Ambient Occlusion:** Normal.
**Tessellation:** Normal.

Advanced Graphics Settings
**Screen Type:** Full Screen
**Long Shadows:** OFF. It's pretty, but your FPS will thank you.
**High Resolution Shadows:** OFF
**High Detail Streaming While Flying:** OFF, unless you're a pilot main.
**Extended Distance Scaling:** Keep this low. It's a massive performance hit.
